# Features need to add

## Functional Dashboarad instead of hardcoding it
    - Tasks from brands
    - Discover Brands/Influencers
    - functional wallet (add a seperate wallet page to the drop down menu and also connect the hard     coded wallet to dashboard)


## Connect Influencer's Social media ID's
    On the Profile page when Influencer adds their social accounts, the profile should fetch the subscriber/follower count and present on the profile in cards(ui/ux).

    - connect the profile button from drop down menu to profile edit and preview page.
    - shift the profile edit tab from Dashboard to workfolio.
